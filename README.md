To compile this project:
------------------------
* I use Visual Studio 2017.
* Requires Windows 10 SDK (not the OS itself).
* Extract [lib.7z](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UyIE_go2FRpS1OaRAl0JE_jcbV8ZfVqf) contents into the same folder that contains AnyRace_CoachAI.sln, so that a "lib" folder with these contents gets created.
