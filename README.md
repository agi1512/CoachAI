**This BWAPI-AI/UDAI (User defined AI) works as an in-game helper and also as an online replay analyzer.**
It can help the players at-all-levels to improve, also to test and sense and remember things that weren't easy/possible before.

> _**Note**_:
* It works only with StarCraft v1.16.1 using ChaosLauncher.
* When playing in ICCUP, the game is logged and you'll get the win/lose points, this won't happen if one of the players is Computer.
